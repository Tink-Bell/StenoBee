Some key points about Stenobee
>
1) Originally made to avoid having issues with dialect differences in vowel sounds
>
2) The default dictionary is made using a raw text file of 445k words (13k unique words), from myself over 3-4 years of my discord messages.
>

>
What is StenoBee is bad at.
>
1) Captioning, and court reporting work, since the orderless non phonetic nature of it actively makes transcription related work harder.
>
2) Ambiguity with some shorter words, some memorization may be needed.
>

>
Some things that StenoBee is Good for
>
1) Can be easily customized using tools provided at the very bottom.
>
2) It's great at encoding long words and phrases into single strokes.

IF you are here, and you are still interested.
>
You can also make the dictionary entirely based on what you want.
>
Using these tools, you can take either raw text, or a ranked list.
>
Then make a common words dictionary from it.
