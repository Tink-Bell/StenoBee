Some key points about Stenobee
>
1) Originally made to avoid having issues with dialect differences in vowel sounds
>
2) By Using the custom Dictionary creation tools, the dictionary can be based solely on your own personal lexicon.
>
3) The default dictionary is made using a raw text file of 445k words (13k unique words), from myself over 3-4 years of my discord messages.

Some things that StenoBee is Good for
>
1) Can be easily customized using raw text or a ranked list.
>
2) It's great at encoding long phrases into single strokes(see example image above)
>

>

>
What is StenoBee is bad at.
>
1) Captioning, and court reporting work, since the orderless non phonetic nature of it actively makes transcription related work harder.
>
2) Small words are often made longer with suffixes if they are less common(see example image above)

IF you are here, and you are still interested.
>
You can also make the dictionary entirely based on what you want.
>
Using these tools, you can take either raw text, or a ranked list.
>
Then make a common words dictionary from it.
