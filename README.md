Some key points about Stenobee
>
1) Originally made to avoid having issues with dialect differences in vowel sounds
>
2) By Using the custom Dictionary creation tools, the dictionary can be based solely on your own personal lexicon.
>
3) The default dictionary is made from 445k words (13k unique words), of sample text from myself over 3-4 years of my discord messages.

What is StenoBee Good for
>
1) It's great at being opitimized for how you speak, using the python scripts to build the dictionary.
>
2) It's great at encoding long phrases into single strokes
>

>

>
What is StenoBee is bad at.
>
1) Captioning, and court reporting work, since the orderless non phonetic nature of it actively makes transcription related work harder.
>
2) Small words are often made longer with suffixes if they are less common, as they are more likely to need disambiguation.
