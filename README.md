Some key points about Stenobee
>
1) Originally started, to address issues arising from local dialect differences.
>
2) Comes with a default dictionary of 13k unique words from my own posts, plus around 8k phrases taken from ngram data.
>
3) You can also make your dictionary from your own word list/raw text (using the tools at the bottom of the page)
>

>
What is StenoBee is bad at.
>
1) Captioning, and court reporting work, since the orderless non phonetic nature of it actively makes transcription related work harder.
>
2) Ambiguity with some shorter words, some memorization may be needed.
>

>
Some things that StenoBee is Good for
>
1) Can be easily customized using tools provided at the very bottom.
>
2) It's great at encoding long words and phrases into single strokes.
